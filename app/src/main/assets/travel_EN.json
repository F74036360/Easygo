When visitors have had their fill of food and drinks, they can move on to the entertainment zone to have some fun, satisfying every member of the family. In the &quot;food heaven&quot; zone, you can find anything from meats to seafood, drinks and ices to foreign cuisines, with so many different things on display you will not be able to see everything in one go. Most notable products include crispy fried squid that&#39;s wider than your face, freshly baked pizzas using longan wood, famous old stinky tofu and stir-fried squid, fragrant rice desserts, pocket-sized but satisfaction-guaranteed creative steaks, and braised snacks made by a former head chef of a famous hotel.\r\n\r\nWhen you come into the &quot;entertainment heaven&quot; zone, you will see a gathering of a diverse selection of fun fair offerings and shopping options, suitable for parents to take their children to have a great time. There are games and rides such as tossing hoops, mahjong bingo, Texas poker, inflatable castles, bungee jumps, carousels, mini-train rides, and pirate ships. Children and adults can play to their hearts content, which is also why it&#39;s called the &quot;entertainment heaven&quot; of Xingren Night Market.\r\n\r\nThe original Xingren Night Market was found behind the Neili Train Station, but due to its inconvenient location, the market was relocated to its current address. Back then, the Sunflower Night Market was located at the current location. The new night market covers an area as wide as three soccer stadiums; at its opening it had already attracted 20,000 visitors, making a new record. Due to its position in the re-zoning area and the proximity to the highway, it has the double advantage of a convenient location and its offering of diverse cuisines. Later on, although it was closed for a month due to Typhoon Morakot, the time was spent to construct corrugated iron buildings from reinforced steel and cement, making the overall structure stronger and more secure. The night market also uses an elevated design as well as lighting facilities to make the night market more spacious and visible, At the entrance is a visitor information center, public toilets can be found in both zones A and B, trash bins can be found at the corner of each street to enhance the overall cleanliness and appearance. The night market has many exits so crowds can be easily dispersed by the better flow of traffic. The parking area covers an area of 1,655 square meters so visitors can easily access the night market. This comprehensive and convenient shopping environment has been created with the hope that in the future, it will become a must-visit attraction for local and international tourists when they come to Taoyuan, creating another highlight point for Taiwan.",

               "_Toldescribe": "\r\n\r\nThe bat cave is located in a ravine north of Sanmin Village; it is a large natural rock cavern under a spring, so the cave is also known as the Shuilian (water curtain) Cave. Since the bat cave is still in its natural primitive condition, as well as being nearby a ravine, it has attracted a large number of bats to make it their home, hence the name &quot;bat cave&quot;. Today, the bottom of the cave is covered with red soil, which is an accumulation of the guano left behind by the bats. One can just imagine the time when bats flourished here by the thousands, and it also adds to the mystery of the place.\r\n\r\nBefore the bat cave was discovered by local residents, it was a haven for the bats. Unfortunately, around 1931, the cave was discovered by the local people who viewed the bats as a delicacy. The animals were smoked out and killed to be eaten. On top of the growing number of visitors, the bats gradually moved away and their numbers have decreased drastically, now only a few remain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you reach the end of highway 114, you have arrived at the entrance to the bat cave trail. The trail covers a distance of 1.3Km, the entire trail is flat and paved with rocks, and you can reach the cave after a 40-minute walk. Walk along the trails and relax under the green shade, which make the stroll cool and refreshing. Along the way, you can take a rest on the wooden bench and admire the tiled mosaics of bats along the path.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWalk down the trail for about 400 meters and you will see the viewing platform in a spiral staircase design. Go up the winding staircase to enjoy a lovely view of the verdant mountains and forget about your troubles.\r\n\r\nTravel along the long forest trail, behind the viewing platform there is a path which takes you down into the ravine; enjoy the natural scenery of flowing water as you walk. The rough and primitive bat cave is hidden within. In front of the cave is a small pond, as well as a large and small waterfall around 50 meters in height. Unless it is the dry season, the water flows and splashes with a deafening and spectacular roar. From the erosion of the waterfall, a deep pond with a diameter of around 10 meters has been formed. The surrounding is cool and breezy, suitable for escaping the summer heat. In front of the waterfall, there are stone tables and chairs set up for visitors to take a rest, enjoy the beauty of nature, and bringing people closer. It is the perfect place for bringing the entire family to enjoy nature and spend time together.\r\n\r\nThe entrance of the bat cave is a semi circle hidden within the cliffs of the ravine. The entrance has a height of around 20 meters; inside the cave it is around 50 meters wide and 21 meters deep. Enter the cave sideways to discover that the interior of the cave is in a half-moon shape similar to an amphitheater. The interior space is unique and spacious, wide enough to fit a thousand people. As it is a giant natural cavern rarely found in Taiwan, it is a one-of-a-kind experience. Although the bats that once inhabited the cave have since moved elsewhere, the awe-inspiring sight of the deep cavern still attracts many visitors.\r\n\r\n ",

The entrance to the hiking trail is located at the end of Lane 281, Guangfeng Road of Fengshu Village. Start from here and you will first pass the side entrance of Fengshu Elementary School, and then climb upwards from the road next to Fude Temple. From here you will reach the Zhenwu Temple dedicated to the worship of the deity Northern Emperor Beidi. The temple is also a local attraction offering tranquil elegance. Next to the temple you will find a straight stairway made from sleeper rails, this is the start of Fengshukeng Hiking Trail.\r\n\r\nGo up the sleeper stairway and through the forest and you will come to a field of silvergrass. Late autumn is the best time to enjoy the lovely sight of the silvergrass as this is when the plant is in full bloom with beautiful white blossoms. The sea of white make you feel as if you are walking in the clouds. This sight is lauded as the most stunning view of autumn. Apart from their beauty, silvergrass is also useful. They are pioneer species which only flourish in poor quality soil with full sun exposure. So you will not find them in deep forests. They grow and thrive in the ground, protecting the land and keeping the soil together with their roots; hence there is no need to worry that a typhoon or heavy rain will cause a landslide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you pass the gently swaying silver grass, you will see the Guishan No.6 Pavilion located at the vantage point, this is one of the best locations to admire the mountain view. Go to the pavilion and gaze downwards and you will have an unobstructed view of the entire Fengshu Elementary School, the houses and building at the foot of the mountain, and if the weather condition is right, even a glimpse of the Taipei 101. Look around and enjoy the breathtaking sceneries of Hutou Mountain and Xinlukeng Mountain. In autumn there is the added splendor of the seas of silver grass blossoms.\r\n\r\nUpon departing from the vantage point of No. 6 Pavilion, you will arrive on a wide dirt and gravel path. There is no need to worry that the trail would be steep and difficult to navigate &mdash; you will still enjoy the easy stroll in nature that you had up to the pavilion while you admire the scenery and soak up the beautiful natural atmosphere. Once you pass the electric tower and the fruit orchard, you will come to a wide plaza of red earth. This open space is the meeting point&rdquo; of many hiking trails. In Addition to serving as a helipad, on weekends, the space also attract many drone hobbyists to come have fun. As many hiking trails converge here, the different paths lead to Hutou Mountain Eco-Park, Hutoushan Park, and Fengshukeng. Visitors can go down the mountain in the direction of the No. 15 electric tower, on this return journey you can see the No. 6 Pavilion which you had already passed and the spectacular sight of the north peak of Xinlukeng Mountain.\r\n\r\nAs you descend, you will see the dazzling glass roof of Minglun Sansheng Temple sparkling like a jewel from the green treetops. At the foot of the mountain you can also admire the pretty European style houses. At the end of the hiking trail is Fengshu Village famed for its flower fields, the charming sight making a perfect ending to the walk.\r\n\r\n ",

               "_Toldescribe": "\r\n\r\nDuring recent years, mural painting has become a popular trend in Taiwan; many communities are using art to create new attractions. Kengkou Community Painted Village is located next to the century-old &quot;Chengsheng Temple&quot; in Luzhu. From the streets of rustic farmhouses with red roof tiles, you can see the childlike style of paintings depicting the lifestyle of farmers. In Kengkou Community, apart from the Chengsheng Temple dedicated to the worship of Guan Yu, there is also a farming community made up of local residents. Now, with the trend of revamping the community through art by mural painting, the residents worked together to paint the walls in the community, and Kengkou Community gradually became a well-known painting community. Mural paintings have expanded from the vicinity of the bustling Chengsheng Temple to the interchange of Haishan Road and Kengkou Road; they cover around 30 hectares of residential and factory walls which spans an area of around 3,310 square meters. Most of the scenes are based on farm life commonly seen in the fifties and sixties. The return to simpler times makes the experience more intimate, which is also one of the main reasons for its popularity among tourists; it is also a favorite location for visitors to take photos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the past, most villagers from Kengkou were members of farming families, therefore the art revamping event organized by Luzhu District&#39;s Kengkou Community and the Community Development Association designed and painted farming village scenes on the walls of the houses and factories, as well as designed painted alleyways. Once you enter from the Chengsheng Temple, it is the start of the Kengkou model community. Here you will find the community map painting designed by the Community Development Association to help visitors navigate their way through the world of painting.\r\n\r\nThe paint village is divided into four parts which include the vicinity of the Chengsheng Temple, two painted alleys, Yongchun chemical factory zone, and Haishan Road. Visitors begin their tour by walking along interconnected buildings to enter a time tunnel filled with rich and colorful paintings. From water buffaloes, chickens, ducks, and other animals drawn in 1:1 scale, visitors can interact directly with the paintings. You can picture yourself plowing a field with the ox, or feeding chickens and ducks in the old sanhoyuan (three-section compound). These simple but meaningful images decorate this rustic village. There is also a brick stove, the type used by grandmothers. By combining the firewood, bamboo steamers, as well as the chimney of the old house, a nostalgic scene is recreated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTurn the corner and you will see the corner shop form your childhood; push the old tricycle and take a photo filled with the flavor of the old days with your travel companions. The Kengkou Community Paint Village is full of wonderful surprises; the walls of the alleyways are covered with a colorful coat of paint which makes it easy to forget the times that have passed, taking you back to your childhood memories.\r\n\r\nApart from the neighborhood around Chengsheng Temple, if you would like to experience something different, visit Haishan Road for different scenery. The paintings look even more life-like along with the common lantana flowers and the trees on the side of the road. If you visit in autumn, you will be able to see the Mexican asters in full bloom in the flower fields, swaying delicately in the breeze and evoking gentle yearnings.\r\n\r\n ",

It connects to the cycling track on the left bank of Dahan River and is only available for use to pedestrians and cyclists. In addition to the lights which switch on at night that adds atmosphere to the night scenery of the Dahan River banks, the bridge was constructed using the Baroque style similar to the buildings on Daxi Old Street. The bridge connects Ruian Road Section 1 and Daxi Old Street, making it simple to take a tour of culture and food over the weekends.\r\n\r\nThe bridge was built in 1934. In the early days, it was a bamboo-wooden bridge constructed from a bamboo frame with layered rocks. It was one of the main routes for the residents of Daxi to the outside world. It also connected the areas East and West of the river. In the Japanese colonial era, the bridge was transformed into a dual-bored cable suspension bridge with a total length of 280 meters, and its current appearance has changed little since then. With the construction of the Wuling Bridge and the Second Outer Ring Road, Daxi Bridge gradually fell into disuse. Due to typhoon damages, it was reconstructed twice, also with the &ldquo;community overall renovation&rdquo; concept, it was decided to enhance and reconstruct the bridge. Construction work began officially in 2001 after the planning of the district office and the Directorate General of Highways, Daxi Bridge would be revamped to become a reinforced concrete bridge with 13 abutments and totaling a length of 330 meters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe revamped Daxi Bridge resembled the old suspension bridge from the Japanese colonial era, the entrance to the bridge has a vintage arch design, added to the carved dome ceiling &mdash; it is as splendid as a palace. Go through the Baroque frescoed archway and walk along the red-tiled bridge while enjoying the elegant style similar to that of Daxi Old Street. The white-grey frescoes complement those found on Daxi Old Street, emphasizing their classical beauty. Benches are also available on the bridge to take a rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApart from the facilities of the bridge, the scenery from the bridge is also one of the famous views of Daxi. From here you can see the splendor of the Shihmen Dam and Tamsui&rsquo;s Guanyin Mountain in the distance. On either side of the bridge, Wuling Bridge and Kanjin Bridge can also be found. When you gaze upon the tapestry woven by the river valley, the rocks and the bridges, it may no longer be the famed &ldquo;Return of the Boats to Kanjin&rdquo; view in the century past, but with the caress of gently blowing breeze and the embrace of nature, the glory of the bygone days is easy to imagine.\r\n\r\nIf you arrive after dusk, don&rsquo;t rush off yet &mdash; this is a perfect place to watch the sunset. In the evening when the lights are lit, the bridge looks particularly vibrant and lively, giving off an exotic atmosphere and showing the other side of Daxi Bridge&rsquo;s splendor. This is also why Daxi Bridge is also known as &ldquo;Lover&rsquo;s Bridge&rdquo; and has attracted many enthusiastic photographers. On weekends and holidays, street artists and performers can be found demonstrating spinning tops or playing music. Along the bank of Daxi Bridge, you can also try your hand at the &ldquo;Love Eternal&rdquo; spinning tops, legends say that if you spin the tops according to the instructions, your love will become even deeper and serve as a testament of love between couples.\r\n\r\n ",

From the originally planned 76 households, the number of residents had expanded to 226 households. The roads were constructed based on a checkerboard design along with the fish-bone design of hostel layout, which created a unique residential space with stand-alone units. Within the community, activity centers, assembly halls, community parks, lawns, sports fields, pavilions, and other public facilities were gradually added which formed a self-sufficient, semi-closed-off military dependents&#39; village. In 1998, it was selected as the national model community, providing the community with a boost of confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTaoyuan is not a region in Taiwan where there is a heavy concentration of military dependents&#39; villages, but it is one of the main regions where the culture preservation of military dependents&#39; village is taken very seriously. The formation of military dependents&#39; villages plays an important role in the transformation of history, it can be said that from the buildings to the customs and traditions, these are all irreplaceable culture and lifestyle heritages. Therefore when local residents gradually moved to the renovated Luguang Fifth Village, the Department of Cultural Affairs of Taoyuan City Government began to promote the preservation of military dependents&#39; villages. New Matsu Village is the second military dependents&#39; village in Taiwan preserved under the &quot;Cultural Heritage Preservation Act&quot; after Sisinan Village of Taipei. In 2004, it was listed as a historical site and elevated to the status of a cultural heritage. Later on it was selected by the Ministry of National Defense as one of the 13 military dependents&#39; village cultural preservation areas in Taiwan; it is also the first military dependents&#39; village to be preserved under the Cultural Heritage Preservation Act.\r\n\r\nWhen compared to other military dependents&#39; villages in Taoyuan, New Matsu Village is recreated through a &quot;museum-like&quot; model. From the various angles such as military dependents&#39; village cultural preservation and revitalization, as well as cultural creative film promotion, the Military Dependents&#39; Village Cultural Creative Space, New Matsu Village was founded. Apart from hosting events such as film festivals and military dependents&#39; village culture festivals, the activity center of New Matsu Village was converted into the &quot;Taoyuan Film Museum&quot;. The museum can seat 76 audience members in the Dolby surround sound cinema. Worth mentioning is that the assembly hall from back in the days has been preserved to become the film screening location where classic Taiwanese films and museum cultural exhibitions are held, so that military dependents&#39; village preservation can become even more lively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo rejuvenate the previously forgotten military dependents&#39; village space, cultural creative markets will be held at Matsu New Village regularly, and artist will be invited to come and station there. So when visitors walk amongst the historical buildings with black roof tiles, brick walls, and the red and while gates, they will be reminded of their childhood, as if they are back in the village visiting their friends and neighbors nearby and once again experience the warmth of the community.

At that time, local Atayal residents were mobilized to build terraces from the peak to the creek valley and dig channels to bring in the mountain spring water for irrigation. As the most beautiful scenery in the tribe, Yeheng Terrace, in its glorious history, separated the mountain into 1,200 layers and had a drop of more than 1,000 meters. In addition to bringing a stable life to local residents, these terraced fields build an outstanding natural landscape in the tribe.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo have the full view of the layered terrace, tourists can take photos along the driveway to Sanguang, which is on the opposite side of Yeheng, and enjoy the picturesque and refreshing scenery intertwined with green terraced fields, mountains far away and blue skies. Besides the rice fields of the beauty of geometry, low houses are strewn randomly in the terrace and straight road that vehicles sometimes pass through divides the terrace into two. In the relaxing pace of life, people from the urban area will yearn for this rural life.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo who want to approach the terraced fields and admire the primitive scene of the tribe at a close distance, each visitor must apply for a first-class mountain entry permit because the terrace is located in the restricted mountain area. In the early days, the terrace was mainly used for rice cultivation and the landscape changed its color with the seasons: from the seedlings, the lush green rice crops to the golden rice spike before harvest. The scene of hard-working farmers in the terraced fields until the sun goes down presents a rural scenario that is rarely seen in urban cities.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn recent years, to compete with the peaches from Mt. Lala, farmers in Yeheng start to grow &quot;Mama Peach&quot; that is harvested every May. Mama Peach wins the name not only because its harvest season falls around Mother&#39;s Day, but also the fact that most of the peach growers are Atayal mothers who are single moms or aged over 60. Mama peaches are fine textured, sweet and juicy. Don&#39;t miss the chance to taste Mama Peach during your visit to Yeheng.",

In 2011, the stadium was adopted by the team Lamigo Monkeys for its planning and management, by combining the stadium with the &quot;principle of territory&quot;, it is the first team to hold all of its home matches at the Taoyuan International Baseball Stadium. Through the management perspective of &quot;Lamigo Home Turf&quot;, they have continuously came up with innovative marketing strategies such as promotions by the LamiGirls cheerleading team, themed parties, related sports products and accessories, creating new trendy headlines and topics to attract more baseball fans to come and watch matches at the stadium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Taoyuan International Baseball Stadium covers an area of approximately 4 hectares; it is a baseball stadium with one underground level and three aboveground levels. Construction for the Taoyuan International Baseball Stadium began in 2008 and was completed in 2009. The original stadium plan included 12,000 infield bleacher seats, but in order to accommodate the World University Baseball Championship in 2012, outfield bleachers were added to expand the stadium capacity from 12,000 to 20,000. Together with Kaohsiung&#39;s Chengcing Lake Baseball Field, they hold the highest number of seats out of all baseball stadiums in Taiwan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginally, the Taoyuan International Baseball Stadium was located in the remote Qingpu Special District, but under the management of the Lamigo Monkey team, the home turf management mode was implemented. Fans of the home team are assembled in the infield bleachers while fans from the opposing team and the cheerleading team are relocated to the outfield bleacher seating area. The infield and outfield bleachers are not connected. Behind the first and third bases are stages dedicated to LamiGirl performances; it is the stadium with the best baseball viewing experience in Taiwan. During offseason, nursing rooms, stores, food court, and children&#39;s play area are set up, besides changing from the usual vendor system, the changes also made it more convenient for parents to bring their children to experience the exciting atmosphere of watching a baseball game while enjoying a more diversified baseball park.\r\n\r\nIn addition, under the support of the Taoyuan City Government, JPR sports stadium consultancy was invited from the United States for the planning of Taoyuan International Baseball Stadium outfield bleachers, with the hope that overseas stadium revamping experience can be successfully replicated here. In addition, connect the infield and outfield to create a 360 degree view space to enhance the match viewing quality of the stadium and bring a high class experience to its audience.\r\n\r\nWith the Taoyuan International Airport MRT on the cusp of completion, Taoyuan International Baseball Stadium will also become a popular attraction along the MRT line. It will be very convenient for baseball fans from around the country to come and watch a baseball game, and Taoyuan City residents will also be able to take the transfer shuttle to arrive at the stadium. The comprehensive transportation systems will attract even more fans to come for games and participate in events, forming a complete baseball lifestyle.\r\n\r\nTo the people of Taoyuan, baseball is already the city&#39;s most important activity. Apart from the sporting equipment available at the stadium store, Lamigo Monkeys are also partnering with businesses in Taoyuan City to create &quot;Lamigo concept stores&quot;, adding trendy designs so that local shops can become supporters of the national sport. This will not only promote the sport of baseball, it also extends the fun atmosphere of the stadium over the entire city.",

Simply turn around to enjoy the lovely scenery of the wide-open green lawns, willow branches gently dancing over the Zhongda Lake, and artworks created by renowned Taiwanese sculptor Ju Ming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWalk down Zhongda Road to reach the front entrance of National Central University. Upon entering the campus, the first thing you will notice is the oval-shaped garden designed along the slope; located at its center are the words &quot;National Central University&quot; formed by Chinese banyan, the striking design immediately catches the eye. Pass through the circle and continue with your exploration, and you will soon arrive at the &quot;Baihuachuan Pine Forest Path&quot; covered by flagstones, Along the way are pavilions, resting areas, and lights. In addition to admiring the sculpture &quot;Taichi Arch&quot; by Ju Ming on the lawn, you will also find a giant banyan tree that is also known as the &quot;Central Park&quot;. As the tree is shaped similarly to the tree logo of Cathay Life Insurance Company, it is also called the &quot;Cathay Tree&quot;; these are all beautiful locations worthy of taking pictures. At the end of the path is an outdoor cafe, during weekends and holidays it is full of visitors enjoying a nice cup of coffee under the sunshine. If you listen closely, you can hear the sounds of laughter mixed with the whizzing of flying kites and Frisbees; it is the perfect place for relaxation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDue to its charming and beautiful campus scenery, National Central University has received much attention from the television industry for the filming of several TV drama series. For example, Zhongda lake where the main protagonists from &quot;True Love 18&quot; fell into the water, the banyan tree where Annie Wu from &quot;Peach Girl&quot; made a wish, the bench next to the Taichi lawn where Angela Chang from &quot;Bump Off Lover&quot; sat, the pine tree path where Vic Chou from &quot;Poor Prince&quot; rode his bike. Even in the recent show called &quot;In A Good Way&quot;, the &quot;Chengdong University&quot; from the show is actually National Central University, where the romantic Baihuachuan became the backdrop for the Christmas ball. During the festive season, National Central University also sets up lights and decorations to bring in the holiday cheer.\r\n\r\nApart from the art and cultural elements present on campus, there are also two elegant fountains. The lush trees next to the lake and falling leaves dotting the lawn add a poetic feel to the scene, groups of students and couples stroll along on campus also add to the romantic atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIf you are not in a hurry, take a leisurely walk on the lawn with your other half and spend a tranquil afternoon on the campus, or lie on the grass and let the sun caress your body, adding another page to the beautiful chapter of your romance together.",

In the early church construction period, in the hopes of passing down the spirit of Christianity through future generations, rocks from the bat cave nearby were chosen as the construction material, these rocks were to be excavated by local residents and carried up the mountain one at a time for the construction of the building. Based on the concept of &quot;a key to enter heaven&quot;, the pastor designed the unique church entrance; combined with the unique design of the walls, its simple elegance is even more obvious. The Council for Cultural Affairs has listed the church as one of the century-old historical sites; it was also selected as one of the &quot;100 Religious Attractions in Taiwan&quot; by the Ministry of the Interior in 2013.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJiguopai Church is located on the tribal grounds of the Dawuo Tribe. Back then, due to the growing number of followers having no set location for church meetings, it was decided that a church will be built within the tribe. To ensure that the church will flourish throughout the ages, under the suggestion of an American missionary Jacob Sun, and the organization of the local missionary Pastor Chen Zhong-Hui, it was decided that the church will not be constructed using the traditional Atayal tribal building material of timber and bamboo. Instead, stone masons from Beitou were asked to come and teach the tribe how to work with rocks; it took about half a year to resolve the issues related to stone cutting. Through the cooperation and hard work of the people of the Atayal tribe, where each person was responsible for one rock, this religious center constructed from rocks was finally completed and named &quot;Jiguopai Church&quot; after the local tribe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the wear and tear of 50-plus years, the church still stands firm today. Even with the construction of a new church in 1994 after the number of followers continued to increase, and the original church was almost demolished after the transfer of land ownership, with the petition from the Department of Cultural Affairs, funding was granted by the government to revamp the building to become a local cultural center. The center was re-opened in 2004, and it still retains the appearance of the original church. The main building constructed from rocks looks like the Noah&#39;s Ark sitting on a hill when viewed at a distance. The cross on top of the church has not been damaged and still retains the unique features of beautiful craftsmanship. At the entrance of the church, a one-size smaller gabled gate can be found. Unlike the sharp and angled lines found in most churches, the soft gentle curves symbolized &quot;clouds&quot; to tell the stories of another form of heaven. The design concept of overlapping squares and circles signified &quot;keyholes&quot; to represent the key and path to heaven. All of this adds refinement and elegance to the otherwise simple and rustic design of the church.\r\n\r\nBy comparing the old church with the new, the uniqueness of the architectural aesthetics of the Jiguopai Church is even more obvious. Back then, rocks carried by the hard work of local residents were not laid horizontally one on top of the other, instead they were placed diagonally or irregularly against each other. After years of weather exposure, each rock has become even more valuable and also imbues the church with a richly-layered facade.",

It is the best-preserved Japanese era Shinto shrine in Taiwan. The architectural style encompasses the old ways of the ancient Chinese Tang dynasty, Japanese style, and contemporary Taiwanese style. The building is constructed from top quality cypress wood. In 1994, it was officially listed as a level three national monument. The Shrine was also used as the filming location for the film &quot;Kano&quot;, where the audience is transported back to the 1930s.\r\n\r\nBack during the Japanese colonial era when Japan was promoting the Japanization movement in Taiwan, around 200 Shinto shrines were built throughout the island. Taoyuan Shinto Shrine was constructed during this period; it was decided at the time to build the shrine on the mountain where the view includes the city of Taoyuan to the southwest, as well as the Kaizhang Shengwang Temple in the city center to symbolize its protection over the people.\r\n\r\nFollowing Japan&#39;s defeat in the war and the ending of Taiwan-Japan diplomatic relations, many Shinto shrines were faced with the fate of demolition and renovation as their number of worshipers dwindled. Taoyuan Shinto Shrine was renamed Taoyuan Martyrs&#39; Shrine in 1950. Due to its Tang dynasty style architecture and the building material of high quality cypress, it was carefully preserved because of its cultural value, history, and art. It is currently the only Shinto shrine in Taiwan and outside of Japan which has been perfectly preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTaoyuan Martyrs&#39; Shrine has a complete range of buildings. The main clusters are the &quot;main hall&quot; where the spirit tablets are placed, the &quot;worship hall&quot; where worshipers come pay their respects, the &quot;administration office&quot; where the priest or management personnel complete their daily tasks, the &quot;water room&quot; for worshipers to wash their hands and gargle before they enter for worship. There is also the Torii Gate, Buddhist lantern, Komainu (guardian lions), brass horse sculpture, and the shrine Sandao (path). The materials used were cypress and fir, with their fine texture combined within a wooden framework which has been perfectly preserved. The beams were secured through grafting joints all painstakingly done manually by hand. Through all of which one can clearly see the detailed labor of the craftsmen and experience even more deeply the stately and solemn beauty of the Taoyuan Martyrs&#39; Shrine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow the terrain and take the steps next the Chenggong Road, you will see the straight Sandao (path) in front of the Shrine. The inner gate and the worship hall are connected by the Sandao which is connected all the way to Taoyuan Train Station. Old pine and evergreen trees are planted around the shrine, giving it an air of serenity. The atmosphere is one of verdant green with the beauty of the ancient times. In early spring when cherry blossoms bloom, the delicate pink petals bring a gentleness to its austere surroundings. In autumn, red maple leaves dot the front yard of the shrine and the parking area. Different seasons bring totally different sceneries. Pause for a brief moment on the steps in front of the worship hall and enjoy the view of the entire shrine from this vantage point. Experience the quiet surroundings closed off in greenery; it is a favorite destination for visitors to take photos and connect with nature.\r\n\r\n ",

The entire recreational area spans an area of almost 1,000 hectares, which includes the spectacular view of a 300-hectare cedar forest. The highest point in the park is the 1,212-meter &quot;Dongyan Mountain&quot;. From the peak of the mountain visitors can see the breathtaking view of all nearby mountain ranges, Taoyuan, Sanxia, and the Tamsui River; it is also a good location to enjoy the night lights in Taoyuan.\r\n\r\nThe two main features of Dongyan Mountain are the &quot;cedar forest&quot; and &quot;sea of clouds&quot;. Due to its elevation at around 1,000 meters, during the early years, the area was used as a cedar plantation; therefore the cedar forest became the most prominent scenery in the park. The several hundred hectares of thick and verdant forest has formed a dense cover which makes an ideal habitat for a wide variety of amphibians, making Dongyan Mountain a good destination for parents to take their children and for environmental education classes. The terrain varies widely within the mountain region, misty clouds often form above the forest in the afternoons, and this is the time when Dongyan Mountain is most beautiful. If you are lucky, you might even see a rainbow coming out from the eyes of the maiden.\r\n\r\nDongyan Mountain Forest Recreational Area has various forest trails with a total length of 16Km; it includes the &quot;self-guided hiking trail&quot; which climbs up the 1,212-meter main peak of Dongyan Mountain; the &quot;knowledge trail&quot; which focuses its displays on the plantation culture and logging industry; the &quot;parent and child peaks trail&quot; with one large and one small peak, looking like a mother leading a child located at the end of the plantation road; four &quot;fossil forest trail&quot; which display fossil and remains from over thirty million years ago. Each of these trails offers different sceneries, habitats, and forest landscapes, allowing visitors to learn more about the mountain through different perspectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best way to experience the essence of Dongyan Mountain is to go for a walk on the self-guided trail, the trail and its various side paths have a total distance of 4Km. If you go from here to the triangulation point of the Dongyan Mountain&#39;s main peak, the total distance is around 1.6Km. The Forestry Bureau provides free map guides, or you can simply follow the sign posts along the trail. Along the trail, many information guide posts offering a wealth of information and pictures have been installed. Walk along the railroad tie-paved trail and reach the top, the full trip to the peak only takes about 60 minutes. There is a wide variety of plant and animal life to see along the way so that\r\n\r\nyou can mesmerize yourself in the beauty of mother nature and bathe in a spa of phytoncides. Once you arrive at the 1,212-meter peak at the end of the trail, you will experience another set of breathtaking views. From the viewing platform, clouds float by with the breeze while you admire the magnificent emerald tapestry of the mountain ranges.\r\n\r\nThe &quot;Knowledge Trail&quot; is situated behind the restaurant and meanders in-between the dense forest and crossing streams; its main attractions are the displays of forestry culture and machinery. Here, you can bathe in the scents of the forest while experiencing the area&#39;s rich history and culture.\r\n\r\n ",

Together with undulating mountain ranges that take the shape of the backs of the turtles, the picturesque view of &quot;Three Swimming Turtles&quot; is shaped that is not only a must see in the Baling area, but also one of the most beautiful sceneries in Mt. Lala. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe name of &quot;Three Swimming Turtles&quot; originated from the aboriginal myths and legends. In addition, river and wind erosion results in mixed mountains and high cliffs, which give the Baling area a mysterious atmosphere. To publicize the beauty of the natural landscape, Taoyuan City Government has built a wooden scenic overlook on the cliff at 5.2k, Tao 116 Township Road at an elevation of 1000 meters above sea level. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe scenic overlook to view &quot;Three Swimming Turtles&quot; is located on Tao 116 Township Road, the traffic artery of Mt. Lala Scenic Area, and has become a new scenic spot since its completion in 2014. While visiting Mt. Lala, tourists can follow the mountain road to enjoy the spectacular mountain views and stop at the scenic overlook to appreciate the fabulous natural attraction. The scenic overlook is the best location to admire the beauty of the natural landscape as well as a rest stop for tourists.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo provide an extended field of vision, this scenic overlook is designed to be a two-level structure. The upper level is a platform with washed granolithic finish that provides a parking space for tourists. The lower level is a wooden viewing platform that offers tourists a spacious place to feel the soothing and relaxing atmosphere. Standing on the scenic overlook, you will have the most beautiful view of the amazing &quot;Three Swimming Turtles&quot; meander valley particularly in Mt. Lala. On sunny days, the peaks of distant mountains covered with thin mist may come into sight. Besides the marvelous mountains and rivers, you will oversee both new and old Baling Bridges and randomly strewn small houses. As you relax your body and soul, you will also experience how insignificant human beings are and how great nature is.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe scenic overlook can be connected to Baling Historic Trail in Mt. Lala. After entering Mt. Lala Scenic Area, tourists can stroll along the path to visit Butterfly Museum, Beetle Museum and take Youjing Trail to head towards the scenic overlook to gaze the picturesque natural beauty and admire the enchanting nature.",

               "_Toldescribe": "\r\n\r\nInside the Xiaowulai Designated Scenic Area can be found popular attractions such as Xiaowulai Waterfall, skywalk, Feng Dong Rock, and Yixing Suspension Bridge. After the skywalk was opened, even more visitors came to experience the thrill of traipsing across the open air. The park offers four unique trails which are the forest breathing trail, refreshing trail, the water green corridor trail, and the ancient water canal trail. Visitors are encouraged to come and relax, break a sweat, and breathe in healthy phytoncides.\r\n\r\nDrive through the Xiaowulai Designated Scenic Area entrance and the first thing you will see is the &ldquo;universe platform&rdquo;, from here you will be able to see the scenery of the Xiaowulai Waterfall in the distance. Using the &ldquo;universe platform&rdquo; as the starting point, go down a few steps and you will reach the &ldquo;refreshing trail&rdquo;. This trail runs below the Xiaowulai Waterfall, and the view along the way features unspoiled nature and numerous views of the breathtaking valley. When you see the eye-catching Changhong Bridge, it means that the waterfall is not far off. Go over Changhong Bridge and you will hear the thundering waterfall, waking you up and refreshing the spirit. When you reach the famous &ldquo;Xiaowulai Waterfall&rdquo;, enjoy being refreshed by the cooling spray of water and being drenched in the negative ion particles of nature.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to challenge the daring attraction inside the park, you have to visit the &ldquo;water green corridor trail&rdquo;. The trail is situated next to Xiaowulai&rsquo;s Yunei River, the entire trail is built along the banks of the river and you will be accompanied by the sound of the flowing water. The cool breeze from the valley makes the walk especially refreshing. Apart from admiring the view of the river, the low-gradient accessible pathway of wooden planks connects to well-known park attractions such as the &ldquo;skywalk&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Feng Dong Rock&rdquo;. Although &ldquo;Feng Dong Rock&rdquo; had not been able to withstand the assault of the wind and has now fallen down, it has not been swept away by the water and the huge rock is still a popular attraction. The renowned &ldquo;skywalk&rdquo; is located above Xiaowulai Waterfall. The reinforced glass bridge surface is 70 meters from the bottom of the waterfall and the entire see-through surface stretches all the way to the source of the waterfall. The thundering waterfall beneath the feet can be seen clearly, providing a test of courage to the visitors and also giving you the feeling of walking in the air.\r\n\r\nIf you want to challenge the next level of the skywalk, you must walk along the &ldquo;water green corridor trail&rdquo; and go to the &ldquo;sky rope bridge&rdquo; and experience the breathtaking challenge. The bridge spans 70 meters in length across the 100 meter deep river valley &mdash; dare yourself over this height challenge to enjoy an unforgettable experience. Carry on down the &ldquo;water green corridor trail&rdquo; and you will arrive at the Yunei River recreational area where you can soak your feet in the cool water and wash away your fatigue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGo back to the skywalk plaza and you will find the entrance to the &ldquo;forest breathing trail&rdquo; next to the public toilets. The trail slowly leads upwards along the steps where you can enjoy being embraced by the forest. Also, there is the &ldquo;ancient water canal trail&rdquo; which connects the Xiaowulai skywalk to the Yixing Suspension Bridge. The total length of the trail is about 1.8 Km. This was the irrigation canal constructed by the early residents to direct the water from Longfeng Waterfall to the waterways of Luofu River. It passes through valleys, bamboo groves, and has a diverse range of unspoiled habitat, making it a secret forest path not to be missed.",

               "_Toldescribe": "\r\n\r\nThe Baishajia Lighthouse is situated on the Guanyin coast, and it is the second tallest lighthouse in Taiwan. Before the lighthouse in Taichung Harbor was built, it was also the westernmost lighthouse on the main island of Taiwan. A circular pathway has been built around the lighthouse which can also be used to access the Guanyin beach recreational area. The white structure of the Baishajia Lighthouse is even more dazzling between the blue sky and the ocean. After it officially came into use in 1901, the lighthouse had already become a famous attraction Taiwan during the Japanese occupation era. A century later, in 2001, it was selected by the Council for Cultural Affairs as one of the &quot;One Hundred Historic Sites in Taiwan&quot;. The main structure of the lighthouse, its surrounding walls, and the sundial from the Japanese era were chosen the following year as the first county level historical site of Taoyuan. It is currently the most well-preserved lighthouse from the early Japanese colonial period.\r\n\r\nBaishajia Lighthouse has a height of around 37 meters, second only to the Eluanbi Lighthouse in Kenting. The most unique feature of this lighthouse is that it is the only lighthouse in Taiwan constructed from bricks and stones, unlike the concrete lighthouses generally found throughout Taiwan. During the late Qing dynasty, lighthouse equipment was usually imported from England or France. The manufacturer would first cast and construct the main structure and lighting components then ship the parts to their destination where everything would be assembled. The Baishajia Lighthouse, which took three years to complete, was not made from soldered iron but instead from what is known in Japanese as &quot;stone bricks&quot;. The double-layered stone bricks were unique in being earthquake-resistant; the circular body of the tower was constructed from these bricks and cemented together with the ancient adhesive substance made from glutinous rice, brown sugar, and lime. The upper section of the lighthouse is constructed from large pieces of stone layered together to form a framework to support the upper section, which was constructed from cast iron. Even after the bombardment of shells during both world wars, numerous earthquakes and natural disasters, the lighthouse has never suffered any significant damage.\r\n\r\nToday, the light house continues to stand tall, bringing light to the Taiwan Strait and guarding ships passing by. The lighthouse structure and its interior design have endured the passing of a century. The Japanese era sundial has also been well preserved; it once held the important task of determining when to switch the lights from the lighthouse on and off by establishing the time, bearing, and latitude from the position of its shadow. Also, a clock manufactured by the Shanghai Machinery Bureau, as well as a century-old chinaberry tree which existed since the Japanese colonial era are both still standing tall inside the garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis bright light of the Taiwan Strait stands in a serene environment surrounded by a stream, bridge, rice fields, and ponds, there is also a boardwalk and winding walk path. The lighthouse is a perfect backdrop for picture taking. If you rode a bike, you can leave it on the side of the road and enter the area on foot.\r\n\r\nInside the visitor&#39;s area is an information room where a tour guide explains the detailed information on the various equipment found in the lighthouse. In the vicinity of the lighthouse are a circular walk path, park, pavilion, plaza, and children&#39;s play area. The walk path follows along the bank of the Guanyin River, apart from the stream and bridges, rice fields and ponds, the famous windmill from the Guanyin coast can also be seen in the distance. The clock tower plaza and the pedestrian arch bridge are wonderful locations for taking wedding photos.",

In addition to the cherry blossoms, waterfall and the river inside the scenic area, there is also the first see-through skywalk in Taiwan. Furthermore, another not-to-be-missed attraction of the scenic area is the new sky rope bridge. It was planned and constructed by the Taoyuan City Government and opened officially on Valentine&rsquo;s Day. The aim is to provide visitors with an opportunity to get closer to nature, free the mind, and remember the excitement from your first romance to create an unforgettable memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you come to Xiaowulai Scenic Area, the most popular attraction here is the &ldquo;skywalk&rdquo; where you can enjoy the thrill of having the waterfall and the valley chasm beneath your feet. After the skywalk, another five minutes down the path will take you to the &ldquo;sky rope bridge&rdquo;. This newly opened rope bridge is secured with cables. The 70 meter long rope bridge soars 50 meters overhead from the bottom of the Daligan River valley. The challenge and electrifying excitement makes it the perfect 2.0 version of the Xiaowulai skywalk.\r\n\r\nThe sky rope bridge was only opened in 2015 and it boasts as the longest rope bridge in Taiwan. The difference to the glass-bottomed bridge of the skywalk is that the surface of the rope bridge is only about 100 cm wide and only allows one person to pass at a time. Before the construction, the structure was designed to be able to handle a mass of 120 ton and also with wind-resistant cables installed on either side to prevent the bridge from shaking too much. But compared to the skywalk where you are looking down from above, the rope bridge&rsquo;s main cable is installed under the path, added to the shaking from the steps of the people in front and behind you, the entire trip across the bridge is extremely wobbly and it feels as if you are swinging in the valley with the wide river bed right beneath you. The cables on either side are about chest height so that visitors can have an unobstructed view of the thick forest and enjoy the unique challenge in the air on the rope bridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApart from the sense of thrill when crossing the sky rope bridge, the view of the waterfall is also worth a look. As you walk along the rope bridge, you will first catch a glimpse of the &ldquo;Mysterious Waterfall&rdquo; hidden in the valley. As the rope bridge is only one-directional, when you reach the end you have the choice of going to &ldquo;Yixing Suspension Bridge&rdquo; or &ldquo;Longfeng Waterfall&rdquo;. If you are feeling energetic, you can choose the &ldquo;ancient water canal trail&rdquo; which goes to &ldquo;Yixing Suspension Bridge&rdquo; and is about a one and a half hour journey. Otherwise you can go to Longfeng Waterfall which is only a 20 minute round trip. The waterfall is divided into an upper and lower section with the two valleys, Long and Feng complementing each other. The upper section is the 13 meter high &ldquo;Long Valley Waterfall&rdquo; while the lower section is the 9 meter high &ldquo;Feng Valley Waterfall&rdquo;. Visitors can enjoy healthy fresh air including negative ions and phytoncides released by the rumbling water and Mother Nature.",
